### Aditya Chechani's init.lua
Prerequisite: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

These are configuration files, for my Neovim setup. It has the following Plugins for now:
1. color.lua: uses [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) colorscheme (_the best!!_)
2. fugitive.lua: [It](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) allows me to perform git operations directly from my editor hopping between the command line and the editor.
3. init.lua (plenary plugin): [It](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) will reload all the plugins every time I open my editor so that I can use the latest versions.
4. telescope.lua: [It](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is a fuzzy finder that helps me navigate between files.
5. treesitter.lua: [It](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) makes the syntax highlighting blazingly faster.
6. undotree.lua: [It](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) is the best plugin ever created. How was the world even functioning without this?

(I don't need an LSP because I am a **CHAD**, _and also because I want to practise coding without code completion._)
